# Drowsiness Detection System  

## Overview  
The **Drowsiness Detection System** is designed to monitor a person's alertness using facial recognition techniques. It detects signs of drowsiness by analyzing facial landmarks and triggers an alert if drowsiness is detected.  

## Features  
- 🚀 **Real-time Face Detection** – Uses OpenCV and Dlib to detect faces.  
- 👀 **Eye & Blink Detection** – Monitors eye closure duration.  
- 🎯 **Facial Landmark Tracking** – Analyzes key facial points for signs of drowsiness.  
- 🔔 **Alert System** – Triggers a sound or visual warning when drowsiness is detected.  
- 🔐 **Hardware Integration** – Supports Arduino for external alerts like buzzer activation.  
- 📊 **Performance Optimization** – Works efficiently on low-end devices.  
- 🎥 **Live Camera Monitoring** – Captures video feed for real-time monitoring.  

## Advantages  
- ✅ **Prevents Accidents** – Alerts drivers before they fall asleep.  
- ✅ **Real-time Processing** – Detects drowsiness instantly with minimal delay.  
- ✅ **Non-Intrusive** – No need for physical sensors, just a webcam.  
- ✅ **Low-Cost Solution** – Uses open-source software and affordable hardware.  
- ✅ **Easy Integration** – Can be used in various applications (drivers, security personnel, machine operators).  
- ✅ **Customizable** – Allows fine-tuning of sensitivity and alert settings.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Dlib  
- NumPy  
- Arduino (for external alert system)
